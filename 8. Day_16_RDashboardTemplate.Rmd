```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(car)
library(flexdashboard)
Salary<-c(2,4,6,8,10,11,14)
exp<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
regression<-data.frame(Salary,exp)
View(regression)
setwd("C:/Users/dhars/Downloads/Dhass/codeing/PowerBI/PowerBi Main Course/Step 6/1. DataSets/R Programming Datasets")
getwd()
ps<-read.csv("PelicanStore (1).csv")
```

## R Markdown
```{r cars}
scatterplot(Salary~exp, data =regression)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
